# Design choices
## Typography

I chose to use the (x) font family for the website (explain why here).

## Colour Scheme

<img width="1600" height="1200" alt="leoneed site colour scheme" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4aa97081-8fb2-468e-868e-6300b82aa565" />

I chose these colours for the website as I wanted to use different shades of blue for the primary and secondary colours, and a darker shade for the tertiary colour. I then wanted to use black and white as they contrast each other well and would help contribute to good accessibility and readability for the website.

I also utilised EightShapes Contrast Grid as it gave me an easy to understand visualisation of how my chosen colours would contrast each other and how I could best meet accessiblity needs with the colours chosen.

## Images

Images used for band members are official material from the game Colourful Stage: Project Sekai ft. Hatsune Miku, sourced from Sekaipedia (link here).

## Responsiveness

I chose to incorporate responsiveness through the use of Bootstrap's breakpoints for viewport size, using media queries to adjust the website based on
